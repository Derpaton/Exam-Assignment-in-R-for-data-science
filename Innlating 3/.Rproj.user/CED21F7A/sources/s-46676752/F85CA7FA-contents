## Data Science and statistics with RStudio

### Introduction

> Similar requirements as for the first and second required assignment (see the previous exercises).

```{r}

# Put your answers to code-based questions into the given empty code-blocks. 

# Run (test) your individual code chunks (Ctrl + Shift + Enter).

# Run All code blocks (Ctrl + Alt + R) before you "Preview" (Ctrl + Shift + K) the notebook in a browser.

```

    By starting a text-line with 4 empty spaces, format your text-based answers into a box right below such questions.

> When finished, run all code blocks (Ctrl + Alt + R) and make a final "Preview" (Ctrl + Shift + K), to be opened in a browser and hand in the document: "kravd3_5021_NN1_NN2.nb.html".


```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

### Load packages

> In this exercise, you will need to load the packages: `tidyverse`, `knitr`, `broom`, `lubridate`, `gapminder`.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(knitr)
library(broom)
library(lubridate)
library(gapminder)
```


### Exercise 1

> a) show the output of `gapminder`. 

```{r }
gapminder
```

> b) investigate the structure `str()` of `gapminder`:
- is it a tibble?
- how many levels are there in the factor variables `country` and `continent`?

    Her

```{r}
str(gapminder)
```
    
    Gapminder is a tibble data frame.
    Country has 142 levels and continent has 5 levels
    
> c) use `distinct()` to show the distinct values of the variable `country`.

```{r}
n_distinct(gapminder$country)
```


> d) use a pipe of `gapminder` to show the distinct countries sorted by the continents. Your results should include the two variables `country` and `continent` with 142 rows of observations.

```{r}
country <- n_distinct(gapminder)
country
```

> e) use a pipe to summarise how many distinct `country, year` and number of observations `n` there are for each continent. Your result should include the variables `continent, countries, years` and `n` with five rows of summarised statistics - one row for each continent.

```{r}



```


> f) make a histogram of the life expectance `lifeExp` using `binwidt = 5` with a facet for each continent.


```{r}



```


### Exercise 2: 

> a) make a pipe of `gapminder` to summarise the number `n` of observations and to compute for variable `lifeExp`: the `min`, `q1`, `median`, `q3`, `max`, `IQR`, `mean` and `sd`. Your result should be 10 columns of variables (`continent`, `n`, `min`, `q1`, `median`, `q3`, `max`, `IQR`, `mean`, `sd`) with five rows of summarised statistics - one row for each continent (tip: you can either use `summarise` or `summarise_at` in your pipe).



```{r}



```

> b) make a boxplot of the life expectance `lifeExp` in `gapminder` for each continent by using `x = continent` and `y = lifeExp`.


```{r}



```

> c) modify the boxplot of `y = lifeExp` in `gapminder` by using `fct_reorder()`to modify the factor order of ` x = continent` to correspond to increasing `lifeExp` (median) and label the x-axis "continent".

```{r}



```

> d) now only for the countries in "Americas", make a boxplot of `x = country` and `y = lifeExp` in `gapminder` and again using `fct_reorder()`to modify the factor order of `x = country` to correspond to increasing `lifeExp` (median). Use `coord_flip()` to get the country names horizontal on the y-axsis that you label "country".


```{r}



```

> e) now only for the countries in "Europe", make a similar boxplot of `x = country` and `y = lifeExp` in `gapminder` and again using `fct_reorder()`to modify the factor order of `x = country` to correspond to increasing `lifeExp` (median). Use `coord_flip()` to get the country names horizontal on the y-axsis that you label "country".

```{r}



```

> f) now, only consider the nordic countries "Denmark", "Finland", "Iceland", "Norway", "Sweden", together with "Ireland" and make a boxplot of `x = country` and `y = lifeExp` in `gapminder`still using `fct_reorder()`to modify the factor order of `x = country` to correspond to increasing `lifeExp` (median). Label the x-axsis "country".


```{r}



```


### Exercise 3

> a) make a pipe of `gapminder` to filter on the countries "Denmark", "Finland", "Iceland", "Norway", "Sweden", "Ireland" and summarise for variable `lifeExp`: `n`, `min`, `q1`, `median`, `q3`, `max`, `IQR`, `mean`, `sd`. Your result should be 10 columns of variables (`country`, `n`, `min`, `q1`, `median`, `q3`, `max`, `IQR`, `mean`, `sd`) with six rows of summarised statistics - one row for each country (tip: you can either use `summarise` or `summarise_at` in your pipe).

```{r}



```

> b) again, consider the countries "Denmark", "Finland", "Iceland", "Norway", "Sweden", "Ireland". Make a qq-plot for the `lifeExp` data in `gapminder` using `stat_qq()` and also add lines using `stat_qq_line()`. Your plot should use `facet_wrap` by variable `country`.


```{r}



```

> c) considering the six: boxplots in 2f), rows in table 3a) and qq-plots in 3b), do you think these six distributions of `lifeExp` are: normal (symmetric), nearly-normal (slight/moderate skew) or far from the normal distribution (strong skew)?


> d) assuming independence of the observations in `gapminder` consider if the remaining conditions for using the two-sample `t.test()` are fulfilled for the variable `lifeExp` for the countries "Denmark" and "Ireland". If ok, proceed to perform a two-sample `t.test()` in order to test if the sample means are equal for these two countries.

```{r}



```
> 
- is the null hypothesis of the test rejected and why/why not?

> e) use `power.t.test()` to compute the power of the two sample `t.test()` in 3d) assuming a minimum effect size `delta = 3.15`, `sd = 3`, `sig.level = 0.05` and `n = 12` in each group. 

```{r}



```


> f) use `power.t.test()` to compute the sample size needed `n` in each group of the two sample `t.test()` assuming a minimum effect size `delta = 3.15`, `sd = 3`, `sig.level = 0.05` for `power = 0.7, 0.8`, and `0.9`, respectively. 

```{r}



```
>
- repeat your calculations for the effect size `delta = 1`. 

```{r}



```
>
- without making the two sample `t.test()` or a power calculation, do you think you can detect the difference betwenn the mean of variable `lifeExp` in `gapminder` for Norway and Sweden using the two sample `t.test()`, and explain why/why not?
- now using `power.t.test()` estimate the probability that you can detect this difference.

```{r}



```


### Exercise 4

> a)  create a scatterplot of `x = gdpPercap` and `y = lifeExp` in `gapminder_6`, that you create from the six countries: "Iceland", "Sweden" , "Austria", "Norway", "Denmark", "France" in `gapminder`. Also, add a best fit linear regression line `stat_smooth(method = lm)` (you get one linear model).


```{r}



```

> b) run the code shown below to create a model object `mod` for the linear model and to output the model summary.

```{r}

# mod <- lm(lifeExp ~ gdpPercap, data = gapminder_6)
# summary(mod)

```
>
The “Residuals:” in the summary-output can be used as a fast check for the distribution assumption.
>
- does the “Residuals:” section in this case indicate any problems? Explain your reasoning.
- finally, show the quality-parameters of `mod` in a tidy format by using `broom::glance`.

```{r}



```



> b)  create `mod_au` to add model residuals, predictions etc. for each data point for the model `mod` by using `bromm::augment` (tip: use `mod` as the first argument and `gapminder_6` as the second argument to keep the original data). List the output of `mod_au`.

```{r}



```

> c) create these three plots:
 - a scatterplot graphic of`x = gdpPercap` and `y = .resid` from `mod_au` to get a residuals-plot.
 
```{r}



```
>
- a boxplot of `y = .resid` from `mod_au` to get a residuals-boxplot (tip: use `x = “mod_au”`).

```{r}



```
> 
- create a qq-plot with `sample = .resid` from `mod_au`.

```{r}



```
> 
- based on your "Residuals:" section, these 3 plots and the sample size, is the model-assumption for the residuals (reasonably) fulfilled?

> d) create a scatterplot of `x = gdpPercap` and `y = lifeExp` in `gapminder_6`, that you created in a). Also, add a best fit linear regression line `stat_smooth(method = lm)` that you in this case facet by variable country (you get six linear models).

```{r}



```

> e) 
> obtain the quality-parameters of each of the 6 linear models (tip: for this purpose, use `gapminder_6` in a pipe-sentence together with `group_by`, `do`, `broom::glance` and the model `lm(lifeExp ~ gdpPercap, data=.)`. Save the output in `quality_6` and output it using `knitr::kable` with `format = “pandoc”, caption = "Quality of the linear modelling grouped by country", digits = 3`.


```{r}



```
> 
- are the r-squared values for the six countries in your new table different, as compared with your previous r-squared value for the six countries in one group?

> f) use a pipe to create `country_au` from your `gapminder_6` by using `group_by`, `do` and `augment` to add model residuals, predictions etc. for each data point (belonging to a country) for the model `lm(lifeExp ~ gdpPercap, data=.)`. Output `country_au`.

```{r}



```
> 
- create these three plots:
- a scatterplot graphic of`x = gdpPercap` and `y = .resid` from `country_au` to get a residuals-plot in six facets by country.
 
```{r}



```
>
- a boxplot of `y = .resid` from `country_au` to get six residuals-boxplots in one plot (tip: use `x = country`).

```{r}



```
> 
- a qq-plot with `sample = .resid` from `country_au` in six facets by country.

```{r}



```


> 
- from your plots, try and make your best estimate of how well the assumptions for using the linear regression is fulfilled in our analysis of these six linear models for each country.


### Exercise 5

> a) import the provided file of football data `results.csv` into the object `results` by using `read_csv` while you set the column format of the column date to `col_types = cols(date = col_date(format = "%Y-%m-%d"))`. 
- when imported, output `results`.

```{r}


 
```
> b) save in `UEFI` a filter of `results` to only include:
- `tournament` "UEFA Euro qualification", "FIFA World Cup qualification", and 
- `date` larger or equal than  "1989-12-31".
- output `UEFI`.

```{r}



```

> c)  save in object `UEFI_home` a pipe of `UEFI` through a filter on:
- `home_team` "Faroe Islands", "Iceland", "Denmark", "Germany", then a mutate:
- to add the columns `score = home_score - away_score`, `team = home_team` and `type = "home"`. 
- output `UEFI_home`.

```{r}



```

> d)  save in object `UEFI_away` a pipe of `UEFI` through a filter on:
- `away_team` "Faroe Islands", "Iceland", "Denmark", "Germany", then a mutate:
- to add the columns `score = away_score - home_score`, `team = away_team` and `type = "away"`. 
- output `UEFI_away`.

```{r}



```

> e) combine `UEFI_away` and `UEFI_home` into `UEFI_games` including all rows from both.
- make a scatterplot of `x = date` and `y = score` in `UEFI_games` with smoothed linear curve (method = 'lm') and facet on variable `team`, so you get one scatterplot with a linear curve per team.

```{r}



```
> 
- for each team, make your best judgement if these plots indicate any progress (dependence: none, weak, or strong) of the results with time, i.e. in the `score` variable versus the `date` variable.


> f) save in `home_away` a pipe of `UEFI_games` grouped by `team` and `type` to summarise: `n`, `loose (score < 0)`, ` draw (score == 0)` and ` win (score > 0)`, and the corresponding probabilities `p_lost`, `p_draw`, `p_win`. Your result should contain 9 columns: `team`, `type`, `n`, `loose`, `draw`, `win`, `p_lost`, `p_draw`, `p_win`and 8 rows of observations - two rows for each team. Output `home_away`.

```{r}



```
> 
- at first glance (not doing any calculations nor tests), are the results `loose`, `draw` or `win` for Faroe Islands independent of the `type` variable (home and away)?
- for this case, test the null hypothesis by using the chi-squared test for independence in two-way tables. Is the null hypothesis rejected?

```{r}



```
> 
- at first glance (not doing any calculations nor tests), are the results `loose`, `draw` or `win` for Iceland independent of the `type` variable (home and away)?
- for this case, test the null hypothesis by using the chi-squared test for independence in two-way tables. Is the null hypothesis rejected?
